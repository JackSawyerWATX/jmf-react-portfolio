	C. Commit to GitHub
	d. Deploy the DSA tracker to AWS Amplify.
	e. Set both hrefs to the public links from AWS.
	
2. Add the Movie App and follow the same instructions as above to update the Project.
	a. Make certain that the items are staggered, left, right, left, right.
3. Django Blog is the third item down under Projects.

Add the Landon Hotel and my original site to #Projects.
They will be labled:

	2. Static HTML Portfolio Site v 1.0

4. Django Records is fourth.
5. Pollster is 5th
6. This should be labeled something to the effect of archived version of the portfolio page along with the details that it is nothing more than a static HTML site.
